# Ingest

This page outlines the different ingest workflows for digital archives, and which is used in which situation. Details of each can be found under the child pages. 

Following guidance such as that of the [Digital Archival traNsfer, iNgest, and packagiNg Group's Disk Imaging Decision Factors](https://dannng.github.io/disk-imaging-decision-factors.html), we perform logical copying unless there is a clear reason that a disk image is preferable, or logical ingest is otherwise not possible. 

At present, the exceptions to our logical copying ingest procedures are:

* CA-DA formatted audio CDs. Our standard logical ingest procedures does not pick up the content of such disks. We have a dedicated workflow for these that creates a single WAV file from the audio on the disk along with a CUE file with track times. 
* Items that fail to copy via our logical ingest procedures, for example due to being damaged. These are disk imaged as a fallback.
* All magnetic media, such as floppy disks, are assumed to be at heightened risk of degredation since creation, and along with their relatively small total capacity, are all to be disk imaged.
