At present, we do not have a robust disk imaging workflow; this is due to all disk imaging software requiring administrator priveleges each time they are run, which is not feasible on our standard devices under our organisational policies. We currently intend to acquire a dedicated device for this purpose, incorporating an internal 3.5" floppy drive.
