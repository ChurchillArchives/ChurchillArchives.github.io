#CD-DA audio ripping

CD-DA formatted audio CDs cannot be ingested with our other logical or disk imaging workflows. Instead, we rip them to a single WAV file with an accompanying CUE file to list the track changes. We do this with [ExactAudioCopy](https://www.exactaudiocopy.de/), using the 'IMG' button on the left of the interface. 

After ripping from the CD, MP3 access copies should be derived of each track, as detailed [here](https://churchillarchives.github.io/pages/manipulation.html#cd-da---breaking-up-wav-files-according-to-a-cue-file).
