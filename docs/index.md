# Churchill Archives Centre: Digital Archives Documentation
This is a work in progress version of a documentation site for the [Churchill Archives Centre](archives.chu.cam.ac.uk)'s procedures relating to digital archives.

This covers the utilities used, and settings within them. Generally we seek to use Windows utilities where possible, and otherwise software that:
* is open source, or freely usable by institutions such as ours
* does not require elevated prieleges (eg UAC) to run wherever possible. Our current procedures achieve this in all cases other than for disk imaging.

These procedures were developed by reference to resources such as the National Archives' [Digital Preservation Workflows](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/archives-sector/projects-and-programmes/plugged-in-powered-up/digital-preservation-workflows/), sites similar to this one such as [New York Public Library's documentation portal](https://nypl.github.io/ami-preservation/), various blog posts from archivists, and resources such as [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). 

If you would like to discuss any of the procedures that we use, you can contact us [here](mailto:archives@chu.cam.ac.uk)
