# Churchill Archives Centre: Digital Archives Documentation
This is a work in progress version of a documentation site for the [Churchill Archives Centre](archives.chu.cam.ac.uk)'s procedures relating to digital archives.

This covers the utilities used, and settings within them. Generally we seek to use Windows utilities where possible, and otherwise software that:
* is open source, or freely usable by institutions such as ours
* does not require elevated prieleges (eg UAC) to run wherever possible. Our current procedures achieve this in all cases other than for disk imaging.
